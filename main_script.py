# Central script to run RIFTEHR program.
# 
# USAGE:
#   -----
#   From Command Line:
#   python main_script.py <Absolute Path to Inputs Folder> <Patient_Demographics_Table_Name.csv> <Emergency_Contact_Table_Name.csv> <relation_map.csv> (--skip_preprocessing)
# 
# Optional Parameters:
#   --skip_preprocessing - If you have already preprocessed and would like to save time, you may set this field.
# You can then give paths to the preprocessed files instead when you call the script.
# 
# For example:
#   python "C:\Users\research user\input folder\" All_Patients.csv Emergency_Contacts.csv relation_map.csv
# 
# You may also define the default paths and variables below, and simply run the program as:
#     python main_script.py
